# IRC Server - Buffer Analysis Mode

## What the server now does:

### ✅ **Buffer Management & Display**
- Shows every TCP chunk received from clients
- Displays complete messages when `\r\n` delimiter is found
- Shows partial buffers waiting for completion
- Provides detailed client information (FD, IP address)

### ✅ **TCP Chunk Handling**
- Properly handles fragmented TCP packets
- Accumulates partial messages in client buffers
- Only processes complete IRC messages (ending with `\r\n`)
- Each client has independent buffer management

### ❌ **Command Processing (Commented Out)**
- All IRC command execution is disabled
- Command parsing functions are commented out
- Ready for your partner to implement command handling

## Server Output Format:

### When receiving TCP chunks:
```
+++ CHUNK RECEIVED +++
Client FD: 5
Client IP: 127.0.0.1
Chunk: 'PASS mypass'
Chunk Size: 11 bytes
+++++++++++++++++++++
```

### When partial buffer exists:
```
--- PARTIAL BUFFER ---
Client FD: 5
Client IP: 127.0.0.1
Partial Buffer: 'PASS mypass'
Buffer Length: 11 bytes
Waiting for \r\n delimiter...
----------------------
```

### When complete message is received:
```
=== COMPLETE MESSAGE RECEIVED ===
Client FD: 5
Client IP: 127.0.0.1
Message: 'PASS mypassword'
Message Length: 15 bytes
==================================
```

## Testing Commands:

1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   ./irc_serv 6667 mypassword
   ```

2. **Test with Python script:**
   ```bash
   python3 buffer_test.py
   ```

3. **Test manually with telnet:**
   ```bash
   telnet localhost 6667
   # Type slowly to see chunk handling
   ```

4. **Comprehensive test:**
   ```bash
   python3 comprehensive_test.py
   ```

## For Your Partner:

The server is now ready for command implementation. Your partner should:

1. Uncomment the `_execute_command` function
2. Uncomment the `_handle_command` function  
3. Implement the individual command handlers in `src/commd/` directory
4. The complete messages are already parsed and ready for processing

The TCP chunk handling and buffer management is complete and working!
